# PICOCHAK

PICOCHAK is a demoscene production (or, simply, a demo) for [PICO-8 fantasy console](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php). It's a funny little demo about fictional space folks, which look surprisingly similar to Tatar national food, and their fight with evil donuts. My friends and I created it for [CAFe'2019 demoparty](https://cafeparty.org.ru), where it took second place in the console demo compo.
